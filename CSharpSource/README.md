## Welcome!

The Microsoft Xbox Live Service API (XSAPI) enables game developers to access Xbox Live. To get access to the Xbox Live service, please apply to the ID@Xbox program at http://www.xbox.com/en-us/Developers/id


## What's in the API:

*   Xbox Live Features - profile, social, presence, leaderboards, achievements, multiplayer, matchmaking, title storage
*   Platforms - Windows Store, Xbox One XDK, iOS, and Android
*   Support for Visual Studio 2012 and 2015
*   NuGet package with binaries for Windows and Xbox One platforms

## Contribute Back!

Is there a feature missing that you'd like to see, or found a bug that you have a fix for? Or do you have an idea or just interest in helping out in building the library? Let us know and we'd love to work with you. For a good starting point on where we are headed and feature ideas, take a look at our [requested features and bugs](https://github.com/Microsoft/xbox-live-api/issues).  

Big or small we'd like to take your contributions back to help improve the Xbox Live Service API for everyone. 

## Having Trouble?

We'd love to get your review score, whether good or bad, but even more than that, we want to fix your problem. If you submit your issue as a Review, we won't be able to respond to your problem and ask any follow-up questions that may be necessary. The most efficient way to do that is to open a an issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/xbox-live-api/issues).  

Any questions you might have can be answered on the [MSDN Forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=xboxlivedev).  You can also ask programming related questions to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/xbox-live) using the "xbox-live" tag.  The Xbox Live team will be engaged with the community and be continually improving our APIs, tools, and documentation based on the feedback received there.
