## Welcome!

The Xbox Live Unity Plugin provides a way for developers to quickly and easily integrate Xbox Live functionality into their Unity based game. 
To get access to the Xbox Live service, please apply to the ID@Xbox program at http://www.xbox.com/en-us/Developers/id

## Getting Started
The Unity Plugin is broken into the following parts

* __Plugin__ contains the various assets that are actually contained in the plugin package.
* __Build__ contains scripts to generate the .unitypackage.
