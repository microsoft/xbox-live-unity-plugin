## Important Notes

If you are building games via the ID@Xbox Program or Managed Partner Program (for Xbox Game Pass for PC on Windows 10/11, Xbox consoles (Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One), and cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate) and need to access Xbox Live features from Unity, you should use the GDK and GDK Unity plugins.  You can find more information on the GDK at: [https://aka.ms/gdk](https://aka.ms/gdk)

If you are building games via the Xbox Creators Program, please be informed that in February 2021 we removed the requirement for UWP games to integrate with Xbox Live to publish to Xbox, and are phasing out software needed to support Xbox Live on UWP. The Store policy has been updated at [UWP Store Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/store-policies)

This Xbox Live Unity plugin for Xbox Creators Program is no longer in active development and will receive no future updates.
